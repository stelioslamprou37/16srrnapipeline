task: >
  You are given a FASTQ file (SRR35094901) representing environmental metagenomic sequencing.
  Run the NEWScoop pipeline (QC → host removal → assembly → binning → taxonomic profiling) and answer:

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: quality_control
    text: "What percentage of reads had a quality score above Q30?"
    answer_type: numeric_percent
    tolerance: 1.0

  - id: q2
    stage: host_removal
    text: "How many reads were retained after host filtering with Bowtie2?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: assembly
    text: "What is the total length (in bp) of the assembled contigs?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: binning
    text: "How many bins were generated by MetaBAT2?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q5
    stage: taxonomy
    text: "Which genus had the highest relative abundance according to Kraken2?"
    answer_type: string_exact
