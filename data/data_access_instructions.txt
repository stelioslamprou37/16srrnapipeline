# Data Access Instructions

The dataset used in this project is a shotgun metagenomic sample from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

## Sample Information
- **Accession ID**: SRR35094901
- **Description**: Environmental soil metagenomics sample
- **Format**: FASTQ
- **Size**: ~95 MB (subset used)

## Download Instructions

You can download the FASTQ file using the following command-line tool:

### Option 1: Using `fasterq-dump`
```bash
fasterq-dump SRR35094901
```

### Option 2: Using `prefetch` (for caching)
```bash
prefetch SRR35094901
fasterq-dump --split-files SRR35094901
```

If you are using Galaxy or a GUI-based environment, you can also search for `SRR35094901` on [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and download directly.

## Note

Due to Taigaâ€™s 2 GB limit, the full dataset is not included in the submission. A subset (under 100 MB) was used to meet runtime and size constraints. If needed, refer to the original SRA record for the complete data.
